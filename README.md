# TensorKit Benchmarks

This repository contains the code for generating the benchmarks that are presented in the TensorKit manuscript.
In particular, the three folders located in the `scripts/` directory each contain the `*_spaces.toml` files that specify the sizes of the tensors that were used, which were produced by the `spaces.jl` files.
Along with this you can find the code for running the benchmarks and generating the plots.
